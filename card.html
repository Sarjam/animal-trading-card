			<p class="description">Peacocks are well known for their magnificent, beautiful tail feather displays during courtship. The Peacocks brilliant ‘train’ contains over 200 shimmering feathers, each one decorated with eyespots. Their long ‘trains’ are not the tail quill feathers but elongated upper tail feather coverts. The train is bronze and green and has a series of ‘eyes’ which are more prominent when the tail is fanned.</p>
